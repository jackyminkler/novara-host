# Build log

Decisions made mid-build and feature ideas parked to protect scope. Newest first.

## 2026-08-18, repo setup

- Scaffolded: Vite plus React 18 plus Tailwind 4 app with the two route trees (`/app/*` host, `/g/:token` guest), functions codebase `hosts` on Node 20 with 501 stubs for `hpGuestView` and `hpGuestSubmit`, design tokens in `src/index.css`.
- firebase.json has no firestore section on purpose, and hosting rewrites `/api/guest/view` and `/api/guest/submit` to the two functions so guest pages call same-origin URLs with no CORS setup.
- Frontend is plain JSX, functions are TypeScript. Kept the guest bundle concern in mind: guest route should get code-split via lazy import when M0 builds it out.
- No deploys yet. First deploy happens during M0 once there is something real to ship.
